INTRO

This script sets up mergeconflicts for testing purposes.

It creates a couple of files with some arbitrary content. 

It then crates two branches (a and b) and makes conflicting changes to 
both files on both branches.

Finally it merges the branches and voila, you have conflicts.

USAGE

create-git-conflict.sh --run

WARNING

The script deletes branches a and b before it re-creates
them. Make sure, that you don't have any branches named a or b in
your git repo. The script cannot check for it.
